# Vite P5 Starter

This is a straightforward configuration of P5.js, TypeScript, and Vite. Will mostly be used by me to make a few hobby projects and to teach younger family members how to code without the added overhead of setup.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/rcoleworld/vite-p5-starter.git 
```
```
npm install
```

## Running

To start vite dev server:
```
npm run dev

## Deploying
