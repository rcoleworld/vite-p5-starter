# Vite P5 Starter

This is a straightforward configuration of P5.js, TypeScript, and Vite. Will mostly be used by me to make a few hobby projects and to teach younger family members how to code without the added overhead of setup.

## Installation

You can follow the below steps to get started or you can just select "Use this template" on the repository's page.

```
git clone https://github.com/rcoleworld/vite-p5-starter.git 
```
```
npm install
```

## Running

To start vite dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

For production builds and deploying please refer to the [vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#deploying-a-static-site).

## Coding
Inside of `/src/main.ts`, add your code to the provided `draw()` and `setup()` methods. For more information about how these methods work or for more documentation on P5.js refer to the [docs](https://p5js.org/).
